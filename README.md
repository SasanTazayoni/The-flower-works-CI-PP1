# The Flower Works

Welcome to The Flower Works README file! This has all the essential information about the florist business website.

## Introduction

The Flower Works is a renowned family-run florist specialising in exquisite floral arrangements and services. It is real business located in west London and has an online presence mainly via Instagram.

The business currently has a website; however, it could be further improved with modern design elements and enhanced features, incorporating semantic elements to create a stronger and more impactful online presence. As a result, I have undertaken a comprehensive revamp, which you can explore [here](https://sasantazayoni.github.io/The-flower-works/).

## User Experience (UX)

### User Stories

* As a user, I want to be able to understand the business brand at a first look.
* As a user, I want to be able to see the prices of products without having to search through various pages.
* As a user, I want to be able to browse through a variety of floral arrangements to see what is available to me.
* As a user, I want to be able to contact someone to ask specific questions and make delivery orders.
* As a user, I want to be able to be able to find the business location.
* As a user, I want to be able to navigate around the website easily.

### Design

Colour scheme:

![Color Swatches](documentation/colors.png)

This combination creates a visually appealing and captivating colour palette that is both vibrant and harmonious.

### Typography

* 'Playfair Display' is the font used for headings with a fallback of the font-stack 'Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif'. Playfair Display is aesthetically pleasing and easily readable. From the multiple suggestions online, this seemed like the most appropriate choice due its vintage appeal.
* 'Roboto' is the font used for the body text with a fallback of the font-stack 'Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif'. Roboto is optimised for web usage and is a popular pairing with Playfair Display. Roboto is also renowned for it versatility, visual appeal and accessibility therefore was a natural choice for the body text.

### Imagery

The images play a vital role in terms of the user experience on a florist website. They are able to captivate visitors and convey the beauty and essence of flowers in a way that words alone cannot. At the time of writing this README.md file, placeholder images are being used but they will be replaced with images supplied by the business owner for the final iteration of the website.

* The logo image is a simple but effective icon that can be reused across many other platforms representing the business brand.
* The hero image is purposely vibrant and beautiful and gives a positive association with the business.
* The image on the about page shows a view of the front of the business.
* The services images show a sample of some of the flowers offered by the business.
* The gallery has been carefully designed with images that are Photoshop-editted so that they are aligned centrally, showing the flowers clearly. This page is extremely important for customers and therefore extra effort has been put into its design so that all images are clear and of high-quality on all screen sizes.
* The modal images are each supplied in a larger size individually to retain the quality of the images.
* The contact page has a placeholder image and works correctly with the grid. This image will be replaced with a picture of the owner of the business.

### Overview

The website is thoughtfully crafted to emanate a vibrant sense of beauty. It seamlessly combines accessibility with small yet impactful features, creating a modern, artistic and elegantly simplistic design.

## Wireframes

All Wireframes were designed for larger screens such as laptops or computers; for medium sized screens such as tablets or large phones; and for small screens down to the smallest phone display. The wireframes can be viewed here:

### Responsinator

When there were browsers that were inaccessible at the time of testing, responsinator was used to make sure that the website was fully responsive on all devices. The results can be viewed for the following:

[Home page](http://www.responsinator.com/?url=sasantazayoni.github.io%2FThe-flower-works%2F) <br >

### Third-Party Testing

One of the most helpful ways to test throughout the establishment of this website was to have a few different people test it on various devices.

| Name | Age | Florist BG | Tech BG |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Laura | 36 | High | None |
| Amy | 36 | None | High |
| Nathalie | 45 | None | High |
| Zara | 65 | None | None |
| Saba | 30 | None | High |

### Lighthouse

Lighthouse was a helpful tool for checking where where the website was experiencing the most issues.

![Scroll up button](documentation/lighthouse.png)

The results indicate that the website is of excellent quality. There are a few issues that were raised:

* High quality images can be a detriment to users with a slow connection speed and therefore need further optimisation. Since the existing pictures are all placeholders, it is unnecessary to optimise until the real pictures are delivered.
* List items should be direct children of a unordered list or ordered list element for proper list structure. While this doesn't significantly impact accessibility, it's a best practice to keep in mind for future projects.
* The website may have some font sizes that are too small for optimal readability on mobile screens (below 12px). While the font sizes are never below 10px, it is recommended to adhere to a minimum of 12px for text to ensure better mobile-friendly experience and readability for future projects.

### PowerMapper

![PowerMapper report](documentation/powermapper.png)

As the results show, the website is highly compatible across all browsers.

### Bugs

* There are no known bugs and any that existed were promptly addressed and fixed.

## Deployment

1. Log into [GitHub](https://github.com/).
2. Locate the [repository](https://github.com/SasanTazayoni/The-flower-works).
3. Locate the settings option along the options bar at the top of the page.
4. Locate the 'Pages' option on the left side bar and click on it.
5. Under the 'Branch' subheading there should be a drop-down menu - select 'Master' from the branch options.
6. Click the save button.
7. Github pages will build your website with the code supplied and begin hosting it when it is completed - the process usually takes a few minutes.
8. The website URL will now be visible on the green bar under the section header. This will remain there permanently and you can refer back to it at any time.
